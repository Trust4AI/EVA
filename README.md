## Trust4AI Component Template

This project serves as a template for the creation of components for testing LLMs in the context of the Trust4AI project. Each component will provide a REST API, a Postman collection, and the docker files required for deployment. 

### Usage

Provide a description of the component, including several use examples and, if possible, a video demo.

### Deployment

Provide a description of the required steps for deploying the component.

### Repository structure

This repository is structured as follows:

- `docs/openapi/spec.yaml`: This file is used to describe the entire API, including available endpoints, operations on each endpoint, operation parameters, and the structure of the response objects. It's written in YAML format following the [OpenAPI Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) (OAS).
- `docs/postman/collection.json`: This file is a collection of API requests saved in JSON format for use with Postman.
-  `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the project.
-  `.dockerignore`: This file tells Docker which files and directories to ignore when building an image.
-  `.gitignore`: This file is used by Git to exclude files and directories from version control.
-  `Dockerfile`: This file is a script containing a series of instructions and commands used to build a Docker image.
-  `docker-compose.yml`: This YAML file allows you to configure application services, networks, and volumes in a single file, facilitating the orchestration of containers.
